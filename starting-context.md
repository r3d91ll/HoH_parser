Direct Use of codegen-mcp-server
The codegen-mcp-server exposes programmatic tools for parsing codebases (e.g., building ASTs, extracting symbols, etc.).
You can invoke these tools directly from your pipeline (via API or Python client), get structured outputs (like JSON representations of code structure), and use them as the canonical parsed input for your ingestion logic.
This is not hacky—this is exactly what these tools are designed for! It’s much more robust than writing your own parser from scratch.
Cleaner Abstraction: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Instead of tightly coupling your pipeline to the codegen-mcp-server’s raw output, you can define a Model Context Protocol (MCP) abstraction layer.
This MCP abstraction would specify the interface/contract for how parsed code is represented and consumed in your system (e.g., nodes, edges, docstrings, relationships, etc.).
Then, you write a thin adapter that takes the output from codegen-mcp-server and translates it into your MCP format.
This makes your pipeline modular: if you ever want to swap out codegen-mcp-server for another parser, you just update the adapter, not the whole pipeline.
Typical Flow
Parse codebase using codegen-mcp-server tool.
Adapter: Convert the output to your internal MCP abstraction.
Ingestion: Feed the MCP objects into your ingestion pipeline (graph construction, embedding, etc.).

<!-- Next Steps
Define what your MCP abstraction should look like for code entities (functions, classes, relationships, etc.).
Write a simple adapter to convert codegen-mcp-server output to MCP objects.

Levels of Code Abstraction
File Level
Too coarse. Useful for metadata, but not for semantic search or graph construction.
Class/Function Level
The most common and practical abstraction.
Functions and classes encapsulate meaningful, reusable logic.
They have names, docstrings, signatures, and clear relationships (calls, contains, inherits, etc.).
Most code intelligence tools (e.g., LLMs, IDEs, code search engines) operate at this level.
Statement/Clause Level
Highly granular (e.g., individual statements, expressions, or AST nodes).
Useful for fine-grained analysis (e.g., code similarity, bug detection), but:
Loses context quickly.
Harder to map back to human-understandable units.
Makes the graph huge and noisy.
Block/Logical Chunk Level
Intermediate: e.g., logical blocks inside functions (loops, conditionals).
Rarely used as primary graph nodes, but can be useful as substructure for embeddings.
Recommendation for PathRAG
Primary Node Level:
Use functions and classes as your main code objects (nodes in the graph).
This balances semantic meaning, context, and manageability.
You can always attach additional metadata (e.g., line ranges, docstrings, called functions, contained statements).
Relationships:
CALLS (function calls function)
CONTAINS (class contains function, file contains class/function)
INHERITS/IMPLEMENTS (class relationships)
REFERENCES (variable, attribute, import usage)
Granularity for Embeddings:
For very large functions, you can chunk them internally (e.g., by logical blocks or sliding window over lines/statements) for embedding purposes, but keep the function as the main graph node.
Rationale
Functions/classes are the smallest units that are both semantically meaningful and context-rich.
Too fine (clauses/statements): context is lost, graph is noisy.
Too coarse (file): not enough granularity for semantic search.

<!-- Next Steps
Define our MCP code object abstraction as:
File → Class/Function → Relationships
Ensure your code parsing pipeline (via codegen-mcp-server) extracts at least classes, functions, and their relationships.
Optionally, add block/chunking logic for embeddings if needed.

ok and because we are using arangodb the semantic value of the content of a function would be contained within the object as a prameter correct?

Yes, that’s correct!

When using ArangoDB as your knowledge graph backend, each code object (e.g., function or class) is typically represented as a document (vertex) in a collection. The semantic value—meaning the actual content, signature, docstring, and/or its embedding—should be stored as properties/fields within that document.

Example: Function Node in ArangoDB
A function node might look like this in ArangoDB (simplified JSON):

```json
CopyInsert
{
  "_key": "my_module.my_function",
  "type": "function",
  "name": "my_function",
  "qualified_name": "my_module.my_function",
  "source_code": "def my_function(x): ...",
  "docstring": "This function does X.",
  "embedding": [0.123, 0.456, ...],  // vector for semantic search
  "start_line": 10,
  "end_line": 25,
  "parent": "my_module",
  "calls": ["other_module.other_function"],
  // ...other metadata
}
```

The "source_code" (or "content") field holds the full text of the function.
The "embedding" field stores the vector representation for semantic search.
You can also include additional metadata (e.g., docstring, line numbers, parent class/module).
Why This Works
You can retrieve the function’s semantic content directly from the node.
Embeddings allow for fast semantic similarity queries.
Relationships (edges) connect functions, classes, files, etc., supporting rich graph traversal.
Summary
The semantic value/content of the function is indeed a parameter (field/property) of the ArangoDB vertex/document for that function.
This design supports both graph operations and semantic search.

1. Function Node Example

```json
CopyInsert
{
  "_key": "my_module.my_function",
  "type": "function",
  "name": "my_function",
  "qualified_name": "my_module.my_function",
  "source_code": "def my_function(x):\n    '''Does X.'''\n    ...",
  "docstring": "Does X.",
  "signature": "def my_function(x)",
  "embedding": [0.123, 0.456, 0.789, ...],  // vector for semantic search
  "start_line": 10,
  "end_line": 25,
  "parent": "my_module",
  "calls": ["other_module.other_function", "my_module.helper"],
  "contained_in": "my_module",
  "file_path": "src/my_module.py",
  "imports": ["numpy", "os"],
  "created_at": "2025-04-17T09:44:00Z",
  "last_modified": "2025-04-17T09:44:00Z"
}
```

2. Class Node Example

```json
{
  "_key": "my_module.MyClass",
  "type": "class",
  "name": "MyClass",
  "qualified_name": "my_module.MyClass",
  "source_code": "class MyClass:\n    ...",
  "docstring": "Class for doing Y.",
  "embedding": [0.111, 0.222, 0.333, ...],
  "start_line": 1,
  "end_line": 50,
  "parent": "my_module",
  "methods": ["my_module.MyClass.method_a", "my_module.MyClass.method_b"],
  "inherits_from": ["BaseClass"],
  "contained_in": "my_module",
  "file_path": "src/my_module.py",
  "created_at": "2025-04-17T09:43:00Z",
  "last_modified": "2025-04-17T09:43:00Z"
}
```

3. File Node Example

```json
{
  "_key": "src/my_module.py",
  "type": "file",
  "name": "my_module.py",
  "path": "src/my_module.py",
  "contains": ["my_module.MyClass", "my_module.my_function"],
  "imports": ["numpy", "os"],
  "embedding": [0.999, 0.888, ...],
  "created_at": "2025-04-17T09:40:00Z",
  "last_modified": "2025-04-17T09:44:00Z"
}
4. Edge Example (CALLS, CONTAINS, INHERITS)
ArangoDB stores relationships as edge documents in separate collections. For example:

```json
{
  "_from": "functions/my_module.my_function",
  "_to": "functions/other_module.other_function",
  "type": "CALLS",
  "weight": 0.9
}
```

Notes
The "embedding" field enables semantic similarity search.
The "calls", "methods", "inherits_from", and "contains" fields express relationships, but for graph traversal, edges are also created in edge collections.
Timestamps and file paths support provenance and versioning.
You can extend this schema with additional metadata as needed for your use case.

ok here is what needs to happen we need to Integrate the codegen-mcp-server into your ingestion pipeline for python code parsing. we already have it installed locally this is its configuration we use for the IDE

```json
    "codegen-mcp-server": {
      "command": "/home/todd/Documents/Cline/MCP/codegen-mcp-server/venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "/home/todd/Documents/Cline/MCP/codegen-mcp-server/server.py"
      ],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [
        "parse_codebase",
        "check_parse_status",
        "execute_codemod"
      ]
    }
```

We should define our MCP code object abstraction as:
File → Class/Function → Relationships
Ensure your code parsing pipeline (via codegen-mcp-server) extracts at least classes, functions, and their relationships. Additionally, we should include block/chunking logic for embeddings.

Let’s dive into the architecture and practical design for a robust, extensible MCP (Model Context Protocol) server/service for Python code parsing and symbol extraction. You’re right: while simple tools can be single-file, a production-grade MCP server for code intelligence will benefit from modularity and separation of concerns.

Core Architectural Principles
Modularity:
Separate parsing, data modeling, API serving, and ingestion logic.
Extensibility:
Easy to add support for new languages, new analyses, or new output formats.
Reusability:
Core parsing logic should be usable as both a CLI and a long-running service.
Maintainability:
Clear boundaries between components, with tests and documentation.
Recommended Component Breakdown

1. Parsing Engine
Responsible for walking the codebase, parsing files, and extracting symbols.
Uses Python’s ast, LibCST, or similar.
Outputs a structured, in-memory representation (e.g., symbol table as dicts or dataclasses).
2. MCP Data Models
Defines your internal schema for code objects (functions, classes, files, relationships).
Can use Python dataclasses or Pydantic models for type safety and validation.
3. API Layer (Service)
Exposes endpoints (REST/gRPC) for:
Parsing files/directories
Querying symbol tables
Getting code object details (by path, name, etc.)
(Optionally) live code watching or incremental parsing
Built with FastAPI, Flask, or similar.
4. Ingestion/Export Layer
Responsible for taking MCP objects and inserting them into ArangoDB, or exporting as JSON, etc.
Decoupled from parsing logic.
5. CLI Interface (Optional)
For batch operations, debugging, or scripting.
Example Directory Structure

```bash
mcp_server/
├── __init__.py
├── main.py           # API entrypoint (FastAPI app)
├── parser.py         # Core parsing logic (AST/LibCST)
├── models.py         # MCP dataclasses/Pydantic models
├── ingestion.py      # ArangoDB (or other) ingestion logic
├── utils.py          # Helpers, config, etc.
├── cli.py            # Optional CLI interface
└── tests/            # Unit/integration tests
```

Example Workflow
User/IDE/Tool sends a request to /parse or /symbol-table endpoint with a file or directory path.
API Layer invokes the Parsing Engine.
Parsing Engine extracts all code objects and relationships, returning MCP objects.
API Layer returns MCP objects as JSON.
Ingestion Layer (if triggered) takes MCP objects and inserts them into ArangoDB.
Example: MCP Data Model (Dataclass)

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List, Optional

@dataclass
class FunctionSymbol:
    name: str
    qualified_name: str
    docstring: Optional[str]
    signature: str
    start_line: int
    end_line: int
    parent: Optional[str]
    calls: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    source_code: Optional[str] = None

@dataclass
class ClassSymbol:
    name: str
    qualified_name: str
    docstring: Optional[str]
    methods: List[FunctionSymbol]
    inherits_from: List[str]
    start_line: int
    end_line: int
    parent: Optional[str]
    source_code: Optional[str] = None
```

Example: FastAPI Endpoint Skeleton

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from parser import parse_file  # your core parser logic

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/parse")
def parse_endpoint(path: str):
    symbols = parse_file(path)
    return {"symbols": [s.to_dict() for s in symbols]}
```

Why This Structure?
Separation of concerns: Each part is testable and replaceable.
Easy to extend: Add new endpoints, new language support, or new output formats.
Integrates with IDEs, CI/CD, and other tools: Just call the API or CLI.

<!-- Next Steps
Decide on your preferred framework (FastAPI is highly recommended for async, type safety, and docs).
Scaffold the directory and core files.
Start with parsing engine + data models, then add the API layer.
Add ingestion/export as needed.
