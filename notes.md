# Centralized configuration and logging are now implemented in your HoH-MCP server

## What's New

### Centralized Configuration (HoH_parser/config.py)

- Uses Pydantic’s BaseSettings for type-safe config.
- Loads from environment variables and .env file (dotenv).
- Example config: debug mode, log level, ArangoDB connection settings.
- Access everywhere as from HoH_parser.config import settings.

### Centralized Logging (HoH_parser/utils/logging.py)

- All modules use get_logger() for consistent, structured logs.
- Log level and debug mode are controlled by config.
- No more scattered print statements.

### App Initialization (main.py)

- Initializes config and logger at startup.
- Logs server startup info and debug mode.
How to use:

To adjust log level or debug mode, set LOG_LEVEL or DEBUG in your .env file or environment.
Import and use the logger in any module:

```python
from HoH_parser.utils.logging import get_logger
logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Something happened")
```

You now have a robust foundation for scalable, maintainable configuration and debugging.

Let me know if you want to see usage examples, add more config options, or have logging integrated elsewhere!

ok so how should we proceed next? surely this can be everything we need to start parsing code files?

You have a solid foundation for parsing Python files and extracting classes/functions, but there are a few key next steps and enhancements to make this a robust, production-ready MCP server:

Recommended Next Steps

1. Expand Parsing Coverage
Nested Classes/Functions: Your current parser only extracts top-level classes and functions. If you want to capture nested classes, methods, or inner functions, you should use a recursive approach.
Relationships: Start extracting relationships (e.g., function calls, inheritance, file imports) to populate the MCPRelationship model.
Module-level docstrings and metadata: Already handled, but consider more metadata (e.g., imports, global variables).
2. Directory Parsing
Add a function to recursively parse all .py files in a directory (using your list_py_files utility).
Provide an API endpoint for directory parsing.
3. Testing & Type Checking
Expand tests to cover edge cases: nested structures, decorators, type hints, etc.
Run pytest and mypy regularly.
4. API Enhancements
Add endpoints for:
Parsing a directory.
Querying relationships.
Health check/status.
Consider pagination or streaming for large results.
5. Error Handling & Logging
Add error handling for malformed files, permission errors, etc.
Use your centralized logger for all exceptions and debug output.
6. Integration Stubs
Add stubs or interfaces for ArangoDB ingestion (even if just placeholders for now).
Example: Improving the Parser (Nested Extraction)
You can make your parser recursive to handle nested classes/functions and build relationships:

```python
def extract_symbols(node, parent=None):
    # Recursively yield MCPClass/MCPFunction and relationships
    ...
```

Example: Directory Parsing Function

```python
from HoH_parser.utils.file_ops import list_py_files

def parse_python_directory(directory: str) -> List[MCPFile]:
    files = list_py_files(directory)
    return [parse_python_file(f) for f in files]
```

Example: New API Endpoint

```python
@router.post("/parse-directory")
async def parse_directory_endpoint(dir_path: str = Body(...)):
    results = parse_python_directory(dir_path)
    return [r.model_dump() for r in results]
Summary
You are ready to parse individual files, but to make this a full-featured, robust MCP server, you should:

Handle nested symbols and relationships.
Support directory parsing.
Expand tests and error handling.
Enhance the API for batch operations and querying relationships.
Prepare for downstream integration.
Would you like to focus next on (a) recursive/nested parsing, (b) directory parsing and batch API, (c) relationship extraction, or (d) something else?

ahh ok so ATM we can parse really simple stuff thing top level class and functions but not functions internal to classes, is this correct?

Yes, that is correct.
Your current parser extracts:

Top-level classes (and their top-level methods)
Top-level functions
But it does not extract:

Nested classes (classes defined inside other classes)
Functions defined within other functions (inner/nested functions)
Methods inside nested classes
Deeper relationships (e.g., which class a method belongs to, beyond one level; relationships between nested objects)
In summary:

Methods of top-level classes are captured (since you loop over node.body for ast.ClassDef nodes).
Any further nesting (e.g., a class inside a class, or a function inside a function) is not currently handled.
If you’d like, I can help you refactor the parser to use a recursive approach so that all classes, methods, and functions—at any nesting level—are extracted and properly parented in the MCP data model. Would you like to proceed with this improvement?

how do we treat imports or variable outputs passes to other objects?

Excellent question—handling imports and variable assignments is crucial for building a rich symbol table and code relationship graph. Here’s how these can be treated:

1. Imports
What to Extract
Imported modules, symbols, and their aliases.
Relationships:
- imports (file → module/symbol)
- from-imports (file → symbol from module)
How to Parse
Use ast.Import and ast.ImportFrom nodes.
For each, create an MCPRelationship with type="imports" or type="from-imports".
Example:

```python
import ast

def extract_imports(tree: ast.AST, filename: str) -> list[MCPRelationship]:
    relationships = []
    for node in ast.walk(tree):
        if isinstance(node, ast.Import):
            for alias in node.names:
                relationships.append(MCPRelationship(
                    source=filename,
                    target=alias.name,
                    type="imports",
                    location=filename
                ))
        elif isinstance(node, ast.ImportFrom):
            for alias in node.names:
                relationships.append(MCPRelationship(
                    source=filename,
                    target=f"{node.module}.{alias.name}" if node.module else alias.name,
                    type="from-imports",
                    location=filename
                ))
    return relationships
```

2. Variable Assignments and Data Flow
What to Extract
Variable assignments (ast.Assign, ast.AnnAssign, ast.AugAssign)
Optionally: Track what function/class/variable a value is assigned to.
Relationships:

- assigns (function/class/file → variable)
- passes_to (variable passed as argument to function/class)
For advanced data flow: Track where variables are used or returned.
How to Parse
For assignments, record the variable name, value type (if possible), and context (function/class/file).
For variables passed to other objects (e.g., function arguments), track the call relationships using ast.Call.
Example (simplified):

```python
def extract_assignments(tree: ast.AST, filename: str) -> list[MCPRelationship]:
    relationships = []
    for node in ast.walk(tree):
        if isinstance(node, ast.Assign):
            for target in node.targets:
                if isinstance(target, ast.Name):
                    relationships.append(MCPRelationship(
                        source=filename,
                        target=target.id,
                        type="assigns",
                        location=filename
                    ))
    return relationships
```

### 3. Best Practices

Start simple: Extract imports and assignments as relationships at the file level.
Extend: Later, add more granular relationships (e.g., within functions/classes).
Type-safety: Always annotate extracted relationships with clear types and context.

### 4. Integration into Your Parser

Add functions to extract imports and assignments.
Return/import these as part of your MCPFile or as a separate relationships list.

<!-- Would you like to:

Add import extraction next?
Add assignment/variable tracking?
Or both together in the next parser update? -->
